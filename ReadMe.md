# togl - typescript ogl

I wanted to use [oframe/ogl](https://github.com/oframe/ogl), but the setup is opinionated enough that I had to refactor to use with my es-module-shims ts setup for using import maps with browser / node_modules. I went ahead and converted it to typescript as well.

## install
```ts
npm i @repcomm/togl
```
